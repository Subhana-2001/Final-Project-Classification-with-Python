# Final Project: Classification with Python

This repository contains the code and documentation for the final project titled "Classification with Python" submitted as part of the [Machine Learning with Python](https://coursera.org/share/79f6d138f3a2e08d8733e911e342cf81) course on Coursera.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of classification algorithms in Python for solving a real-world problem. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation of classification models using various metrics.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, exploration, and feature engineering.
2. **Model Building**: Implementation of classification models including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Calculation of various metrics such as accuracy, Jaccard index, F1-score, and log loss for each model.
4. **Report**: Presentation of the results and metrics in a tabular format.

## Data

The original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from (http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/).

The dataset to be used has extra columns like 'RainToday' and our target is 'RainTomorrow', which was gathered from the Rattle at (https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkML0101ENSkillsNetwork20718538-2022-01-01)

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of classification algorithms to solve a real-world problem. It provides insights into the performance of different models based on various evaluation metrics.

The project highlights the effectiveness of classification algorithms in making predictions and decisions based on data. It also serves as a practical example of how to preprocess data, build and evaluate machine learning models, and report the results.

By completing this project, I've gained valuable experience in working with classification tasks and can apply these skills to similar problems in the future.
